Logistics encompasses a complex network of processes and logistics operations essential for the production and distribution of goods to consumers. This intricate system involves multiple stages, including sourcing raw materials, manufacturing products, warehousing, inventory management, transportation, and final delivery to the end-user.

Supply chain analysis is a critical approach to examining these interconnected elements. It involves a detailed examination of each component within the supply chain, from procurement to production, distribution, and beyond. The goal of this analysis is to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement within the supply chain.
